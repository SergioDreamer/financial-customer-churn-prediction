# Financial Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning system to predict customer churn for financial institutions. It demonstrates a comprehensive approach to developing a churn prediction model, from data preparation to deployment, with a focus on interpretability and business impact.

## Business Context
Customer churn is a critical concern for financial institutions. Identifying customers at risk of leaving allows for proactive retention strategies, ultimately improving customer lifetime value and reducing acquisition costs. This project provides a framework for:
- Identifying customers at high risk of churning
- Understanding key factors that contribute to churn
- Implementing targeted intervention strategies based on data-driven insights

## Technical Details

### Data
The project uses [dataset description will be updated once data is sourced] to train and evaluate churn prediction models. The data includes customer demographics, transaction patterns, product usage, and engagement metrics.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Understanding patterns and relationships in the data
3. **Model Development**: Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
4. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive assessment using various metrics
5. **Interpretability**: SHAP/LIME analysis for feature importance
6. **Deployment**: API framework for model serving

### Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and modeling
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and other ML libraries
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Flask/FastAPI for API development

## Getting Started
This section provides instructions on how to set up and run the customer churn prediction project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher (code executed using Python 3.12.8)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Git

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SergioDreamer/financial-customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd financial-customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages (under your venv if created):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/raw` directory. Ensure the data is in CSV format.
    
5. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to follow the project workflow.
