# Financial Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning system to predict customer churn for financial institutions. It demonstrates a comprehensive approach to developing a churn prediction model, from data preparation to deployment, with a focus on interpretability and business impact.

## Business Context
Customer churn is a critical concern for financial institutions. Identifying customers at risk of leaving allows for proactive retention strategies, ultimately improving customer lifetime value and reducing acquisition costs. This project provides a framework for:
- Identifying customers at high risk of churning
- Understanding key factors that contribute to churn
- Implementing targeted intervention strategies based on data-driven insights

## Technical Details

### Data
The project uses [dataset description will be updated once data is sourced] to train and evaluate churn prediction models. The data includes customer demographics, transaction patterns, product usage, and engagement metrics.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Understanding patterns and relationships in the data
3. **Model Development**: Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
4. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive assessment using various metrics
5. **Interpretability**: SHAP/LIME analysis for feature importance
6. **Deployment**: API framework for model serving

### Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and modeling
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and other ML libraries
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Flask/FastAPI for API development

## Getting Started
[Installation and usage instructions will be added]

## Future Improvements
[To be added as the project progresses]

## Ethical Considerations
This project addresses fairness, bias, and privacy concerns in predictive modeling for financial services. Specific measures include:
- Fairness assessment across demographic groups
- Transparency in model explanations
- Privacy-preserving techniques in data handling
